# This file is used by git to clean up inconsistencies in the author names and
# email addresses in the commit history.
#
# To specify that the author Alternative Name <alternative@ema.il>
# should be corrected to Preferred Name <preferred@ema.il>, type:
#
#   Preferred Name <preferred@ema.il> Alternative Name <alternative@ema.il>
#
# Alternative Name can be omitted, in which case any commit matching
# alternative@ema.il is corrected. alternative@ema.il can also be omitted,
# in which case any commit matching preferred@ema.il has only its name corrected.
#
# Let's try to keep the list sorted alphabetically!
#
